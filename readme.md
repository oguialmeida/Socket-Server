### 1) Develop a UDP server using sockets that handles clients by reversing a received string (prompt the client to enter the message to be reversed). Use UDP.

### 2) Implement a multicast socket program consisting of a server that handles clients by reversing a received string (prompt the client to enter the message to be reversed). Use UDP.

Implement two programs in Python as described below:

- **[PROGRAM 1]** Develop a server using RPC that handles clients by reversing a received string (prompt the client to enter the message to be reversed).

- **[PROGRAM 2]** Develop a client-server system using RPC, where the client inputs two numbers, sends them to the server, which sums the numbers and returns the result. The client should display the result.

#### Open one of the folders in the terminal

#### How to run the project:

#### Make sure Python 3 is installed

#### Open a terminal to run the server
```bash
python servidor.py
